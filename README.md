## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Puneeth1615/Follow-My-Plate.git](https://github.com/Puneeth1615/Follow-My-Plate.git)
    cd Follow-My-Plate
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env` and add the following:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY='YOUR_VERY_LONG_AND_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY'
    DATABASE_URL='postgresql://follow_my_plate_db_user:nxsvBMiWdCEpoDwuYLpk5r8gSYxn0pqz@dpg-d1mdl963jp1c73em85e0-a.singapore-postgres.render.com/follow_my_plate_db'
    ```
    * **Replace `YOUR_VERY_LONG_AND_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY`** with a strong, randomly generated key. You can generate one in Python: `import os; print(os.urandom(24).hex())`.
    * The `DATABASE_URL` connects to the Render PostgreSQL database. Ensure connectivity to Render's database from your local machine (e.g., firewall rules).

5.  **Initialize and run database migrations:**
    *(Ensure your virtual environment is active and you are in the project root)*
    ```bash
    flask db init          # Only run once for the project
    flask db migrate -m "Initial database schema with User and FoodEntry models"
    flask db upgrade
    ```
    *These commands will connect to your specified PostgreSQL database (from `.env`) and create the necessary tables.*

6.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on Render using a `render.yaml` blueprint.

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  **Push code to GitHub:** Ensure your latest code is pushed to your `main` branch.
2.  **Configure Environment Variables on Render:** In your Render dashboard, go to your web service settings and add `SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable with your strong generated key. The `DATABASE_URL` is already in `render.yaml`.
3.  **Deploy:** Render will automatically build and deploy your service. Monitor the deployment logs for progress and any issues.
